ROMs are not included. In order to use this arcade, you need to provide a correct ROM file.

1) Add the required zipped rom file to the rom folder in releases.

2) Execute bat file - it will show the name of zip file containing required files.

3) Find this zip file somewhere. You need to find the file exactly as required.
   Do not rename other zip files even if they also replresent the same game - they are not compatible!
   The name of zip is taken from M.A.M.E. project, so you can get more info about
   hashes and contained files there.

4) If everything goes without errors or warnings, then you will get the rom file.

6) Place the rom file into root of SD card together with the .rbf file.
